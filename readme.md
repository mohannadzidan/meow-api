## Endpoints
The Server provides a number of endpoints (RESFTful endpoints)

### Authentication `/api/auth`
The authentication is done using JWT encoded id tokens, the token is sent with each request in the header `id-token`.

if the token is not specified, expired or invalid the response will have 401 UNAUTHORIZED HTTP status code.

| METHOD | Description                              | implemented |
|--------|------------------------------------------|-------------|
|POST    | Authenticate user using email/password   | Yes         |
|GET     | Refresh token-id                         | Partially   |
#### 1. Authenticating user with credentials using POST
The credentials is sent to the server as JSON object in the request body.
```json
{
    "email": "email@provider.x (5-64 string)",
    "password": "password (8-64 string)"
}
```
A successful request will be indicated by a 200 OK HTTP status code. a JSON object of user data with additional property `"token"` that holds the value of `id-token` will be in the response body.
```json
 {
   "uid": "00d24062206944bc9b21aee0522e33a8",
   "email": " rafiqborak327@gamil.com",
   "username": " Rafiq27",
   "displayName": " Rafiq Borak",

if the credentials is incorrect the response will have 409 CONFLICT status code and an empty body. 
#### 2. Refresh `id-token` using GET
A request to this endpoint must define the `id-token` and `refresh-token` headers, once the request is processed by the server, the server will respond with the user data that matches this token id in addition to new `refresh-token` and `id-token` if this token is expired, or with the same tokens if the `id-token` Ã­sn't expired.
